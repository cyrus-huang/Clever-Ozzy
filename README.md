# Background story:

Olive University is a famous university in a city where smart animals and humans live together. Ozzy is a cat who is one of the several animal freshmen at Olive University. Today is his first day on campus, and he meets a girl called Lisa who's standing beside the lake. Lisa is a nice senior and teaches him a lot about life in the university. Meanwhile, a guy is watching Ozzy and Lisa's talk at the cornerâ€¦

# Game mechanism:

1. There will be an NPC called Felix that chases Ozzy when they first meet.
2. Another NPC, Lisa, is kind and helpful. She will be your guide on campus most of the time.
3. There are two storylines: Felix's line and Lisa's line, each with a different plot. Players can choose to follow one of the storylines. Different storylines will have different goals.
4. The game has two time modes: day time and dream time. Ozzy will live and explore the campus during the daytime. Once he goes home to sleep or to the library to study, dream time begins. There will be small games in dreams that will affect Ozzy's status.

# How to play:

## Ozzy's Life on Campus

Learn more knowledge on campus or find a way out? It's up to you to decide!

Whatever you choose, you should meet basic life needs. Go to the restaurant to check if someone kind has left food for you there!
Notice that if you go hungry for a long time, you will gradually become weaker and less clear-headed, which is very dangerous!
